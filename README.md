Dive into data structures time complexity.

this refers to the time takenn to search, remove, add, set
a value in lists, arrays...

the best case
normal(expected) case
worst case

O(1) - refers to contant complexity, adding value in an array at index n, n+1 is the same
O(n) -  linear complexity, time taken is directly proportional to number of operations
O(n^2) - Quadratic complexity, time taken is the square of number of operations
O(log n) - logarithmic complexity, used in binary search,
O(n!) factorial/Combinational complexity
